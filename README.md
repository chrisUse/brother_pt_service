This is a project based on the project https://github.com/treideme/brother_pt.git which provides a USB based communication to the brother pt label printer.

For me the tool was fantastic and helps me to communicate after sum years of frustrating with the printer UI, to print dynamic and fast labes.
For my work optimisation and the problem on construction places i would like to have a PWA UI to generate dynamic labels with bulk optimisation.
I would also to reduce the waste of label cuts before the prints starts. So i would like to have the option to print multiple labels in on step.
So i create sum code with AI to genrate a API witch was communicate with the brother_pt project code and the AI generates a PWA UI to manage the prints.
